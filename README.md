# Zabbix
If you want to set the zabbix agent properties all you have to do
is modify the 'zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf' file. Set the 'ServerActive'
property if you want to set the connection with a OpenbusBR javaproxy project.

DONT FORGET to set the 'Zabbix Agent(Active)' type in the panel (UI) for the
'Agent Ping' item.
